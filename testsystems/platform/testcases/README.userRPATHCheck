This is a description of new tests for DENX Unix Test Suite


- The RPATH_Check test -

The test is designed to check that the DT_RPATH tag in the target ELF files
to does not refer to the build host directories (this had happened before
because the packages are built with 'libtool', which is not suitable
for cross-compilation on default configurations).

The test searches for the binary files and shared libraries on the given
path and checks if the files contain correct a DT_RPATH value.
The following hard-coded DT_RPATH values are assumed to be correct:
"/usr/lib", "/lib", "/usr/lib64", "/lib64", "/etc/appWeb/bin",
"/usr/local/xenomai/lib", "$ORIGIN".


The RPATH_Check test file can be found at the following location:
	testsystems/platform/testcases/userRPATHCheck.exp
The DUTS framework RPATH_Check test description file is located at
testsystems/platform/testcases/host/rpath_check.tc

The test should be run with the following command line:
	# ROOTPATH=<eldk-target-path-to-check> ./duts -d testsystems/platform t \
      host -t RPATH_Check
where ROOTPATH is the path where the files should be checked; the "-d
testsystems/platform" switch enables test cases located in the
testsystems/platform directory; the "t host" switch chooses "host"
target device and the "-t RPATH_Check" switch launches the RPATH_Check
test case.

If the ROOTPATH is not defined, the CFG_ROOTPATH variable defined in the
devices/host.tgt file is used ("/opt/eldk").
