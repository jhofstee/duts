#
# This file contains abstractions that represent physical target devices.
#
# An individual device is described by the duts_device structure
#
# duts_device <name> {
#	Internals ...
#	Vars {
#		...
#	}
#
# A duts_device of <name> _common is handled specially: it is supposed to
# contain params/entries shared by all devices within a given testsystem, for
# example Internals pointer will often be generic and there is no need to
# repeat such entry in every device's section, similarly some Vars can be
# shared between devices. When _common exists, individual device's sections
# can still overwrite entries (Vars etc.) with their own values.
#
# Per current convention, files containing duts_device descriptions
# should have names with .tgt suffix and be placed in
# testsystems/<testsystem_dir>/devices sub-dir in order for DUTS to recognize
# and read them in.
# 
# Each .tgt file can have any number of duts_device structures and there can
# by any number of .tgt files in 'devices' sub-directory.

	# section Internals, mandatory (must be defined in either _common or
	#				board-dedicated duts_device structure)
	#
	# points to a file with implementation of device's operations
	# (methods); the mandatory procedures to be implemented are:
	#
	# _device_power_on
	# _device_power_off
	# _device_connect_target
	# _device_connect_host (if remote VL access is required)
	# _device_current_context
	#
	# Please refer to default implementation of the above for DENX VL in
	# testsystems/common/devices/VL_devices.tcl file

	# section Vars, optional
	#
	# defines user-provided variables that can be used in test cases'
	# sections Commands, Pre and Post. When setting Vars please follow 
	# guidelines and notes:
	#
	# 1. there are no restrictions for varnames, the important notice is
	# they are converted internally to globals and there's no checking for
	# conflicts with other globals; it is therefore recommended to use
	# some prefix, the suggested convention is CFG_<SOMETHING> (all
	# uppercase); to minimize such conflicts it is also recommended not to
	# use var names starting with an underscore "_" as this is often used
	# internally by the framework.
	#
	# 2. built-in vars:
	# - BOARD (it is subsituted with the currently selected board name)
	# (only one built-in var currently exists)
	#
	# 3. once defined in Vars section variables (or the built-ins) can be 
	# used everywhere in TC Commands, Pre and Post sections' bodies
	#
	# 4. important restriction applies when using *U-Boot* vars in
	# commands - we want these to be NOT substituted (by using {} brackets
	# instead of "" as delimiters), so it's not allowed to use both DUTS
	# and U-Boot vars in the same command line - please visit TC
	# UBootInstallRamdisk for example (testsystems/dulg/testcases/02_non-59.tc)
